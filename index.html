        “If you want to hear the distant voice of the ocean put your ear to the
        lips of a seashell.” ― Curtis Tyrone Jones

        It's a lovely experience to walk on the beach, and it can be made even
        lovelier by finding a large empty seashell and putting it to your ear,
        and hearing the sounds of the ocean. It also gives grown-ups a feeling
        of benevolent omnipotence to pass the shell to kids, and to see the
        amazement on their faces. The ocean can't possibly be inside the shell,
        so the sounds of the ocean coming from the pink walls of a seashell seem
        like magic.

        Inspiration for scientific discoveries can come from the most ordinary
        things: For Newton, it came from watching falling apples. Rising water
        in a bathtub inspired Archimedes. But for theoretical biologist Dr Hans
        Meinhardt, revelation struck while looking at the beautiful pigment
        patterns of mussel shells on his dinner plate at an Italian restaurant
        in 1980.

        The fact that all shells sound just a little bit like the ocean is
        purely coincidental. Holding any sort of Helmholtz resonator to your ear
        will produce a similar effect.

        The seashell you're listening to—the inside of which has many hard, curved surfaces great for reflecting sound—is essentially doing the same thing you just did with your mouth.

        The term “ocean acidification” brings up visions of acid water eating away at a poor, defenseless oyster. But that’s really not the case, Rivest says.
